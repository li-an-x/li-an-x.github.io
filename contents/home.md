Iâ€™m Lian, a fourth-year undergraduate physics student at the Georgia Institute of Technology with broad interests in quantum information theory, AMO, and condensed matter physics. Advised by Prof. Spencer Bryngelson in the School of Computational Science and Engineering, my current research focuses on integrating quantum algorithms with computational fluid dynamics (CFD), specifically on stability of different methods and the effect of noises on iterative solvers. I explore hybrid classical-quantum algorithms, their stability, and the impact of noise on iterative solvers.
