Iâ€™m Lian, a fourth-year undergraduate physics student at the Georgia Institute of Technology with broad interests in quantum information theory, atomic, molecular and optical physics (AMO), and condensed matter physics. Advised by Prof. Spencer Bryngelson in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech, my current research focuses on integrating quantum algorithms with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Specifically, I explore hybrid classical-quantum algorithms, stability of different methods, and the impact of noise on iterative solvers.
