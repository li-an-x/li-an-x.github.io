Iâ€™m Lian, a fourth-year undergraduate physics student (with a minor in aerospace engineering) at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am interested in further exploring quantum information theory and AMO physics. Currently, I am researching applying quantum algorithms in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems.
